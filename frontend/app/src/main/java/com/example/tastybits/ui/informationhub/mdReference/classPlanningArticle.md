# Class Planning

## Overview

Class planning requires a cumulative view of what classes you need to take in order to fufill the requirements for your major or minor. Typically a google search for your "UC Berkeley [your major] [your department] worksheet" will land you on a helpful worksheet that you can use to plan out what your major requirements are.

Furthermore, helpful requirement fufillment information and planning tools are available on the "Degree Requirements" of the [Academics page of CalCentral](https://calcentral.berkeley.edu/academics). You can use the "Resources" section in this guide to help you plan your classes after you have checked

## Transfer Student Tips

- **Degree Requirements**

Review the Degree Requirements page to get a sense of all of the general education and unit requirements you will need.

- **Initial Transfer Credit Review**

If you do not have seven-course breadth satisfied, that can be a good place to start to round out your first semester schedule. Since your Initial Transfer Credit Review will not yet be completed, see if there are any breadth requirements you are confident you have not yet satisfied with previous coursework (or use [assist.org](https://assist.org) if you took California Community College coursework but did not satisfy IGETC).

- **General Education Requirements**

If you satisfied IGETC or UC Reciprocity, you may still have the following general education requirements remaining, which could be planned into your first semester schedule: `American History`, `American Institutions`, `American Cultures`

- **Next Step**

If you have completed all general education requirements, you can work on elective units. You may wish to start making progress toward the degree requirement of needing 6 upper division units outside of your major.

## Golden Bear Advising

- **Golden Bear Advising**

Golden Bear Advising(link is external) is mandatory, self-paced, online course that introduces you to academic resources and your college. Through Golden Bear Advising, you will learn how to build your first semester schedule and prepare to enroll in classes. The course includes:
communication with an Academic Adviser,
overview of academic resources, and graduation requirements.

- **Incoming Transfer Advising**

Once GBA begins for transfers, you will have an opportunity to connect with your intended major's Undergraduate Major Adviser. This adviser will help you assess which courses you should take in Fall based on your progress toward the major and make sure you understand how to declare your major when you are ready.

- **All Incoming Students**

The academic adviser you work with during GBA is different than your Admissions Officer, who you can find through your MAP@berkeley(link is external) Admissions portal. Your L&S College or Undergraduate Major Adviser will focus on your academic questions related to starting at Cal. Your Admissions Officer will answer questions about your new student checklist or questions related to your admission.

- **Majors & Minors**

The Majors & Minors section includes several pages that will help you learn more about declaring or changing majors, adding double majors and simultaneous degrees, minors, and more.

- **Unit Ceiling and Semester Limit**

The Unit Ceiling and Semester Limit will help you understand the time allowed for degree completion.
